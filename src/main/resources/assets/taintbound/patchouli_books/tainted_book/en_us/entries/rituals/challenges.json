After that, a rift will open in the enchantment structure, invisible to the eye, if possible, which, if certain requirements are met, will consolidate and begin to feed the enchantment. According to your calculations, the gain is possible exactly 23 times."

Each form was assigned its own letter of the Greek alphabet. Omega is the very first form, the weakest. Alpha is the last form, the most important."
